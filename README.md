# pipex
Pipex is a shell programming project assigned by 42 coding school. The project requires students to implement a simplified version of the pipe operator in Unix-like systems using the C programming language. The program takes two file paths and a sequence of commands as input and executes the commands on the data read from the first file, with the output redirected to the second file. The project requires students to handle errors and edge cases, such as file permissions and non-existent files, and to implement features such as file redirection and multiple command execution. Students are also required to optimize their implementation for performance by minimizing the number of system calls and using fork and execve system calls to create child processes to execute the commands. The project tests the students' understanding of shell programming concepts and their ability to manipulate file descriptors and process execution in a Unix-like environment.
